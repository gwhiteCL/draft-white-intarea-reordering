We could use https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/90.811445 perhaps. It's a very readable paper.\n\nThe first paragraph is twenty years old, being unaltered from 3819. It starts from an assumption that we want to eliminate reordering, and it says that sometimes that's not ideal. However the thrust of our draft is that we want links to do less resequencing. I think this paragraph needs amending to fit with its new surrounding context.\n\nThe second paragraph says \"_Nonetheless, there may exist implementations of network protocols that do not work well in the presence of a significant amount of packet reordering._\" In another part of the document we say that IPSEC and L2TP don't like reordering. So we shouldn't say \"there may exist\", because we know they exist. There may be others too. Hopefully they are rare, and they don't break completely but just degrade.\n\nThe final paragraph is succinct and should stay.",

I also adjusted the second paragraph to say \"there do exist\" rather than \"there may exist\".\n\nThat's all that I have time for today, but let's continue to work on improving it.\n",

         Proposal for Updates to Guidance on Packet Reordering
                 draft-white-intarea-reordering-latest

Abstract

   Several link technology standards mandate that equipment guarantee
   in-order delivery of layer 2 frames, apparently due to a belief that
   this is required by higher layer protocols.  In addition, certain
   link types can introduce out-of-order arrivals at the end of the
   layer 2 link, which the receiving equipment is required to rectify by
   delaying higher sequenced frames until all lower sequenced frames can
   be delivered or are deemed lost.  The delaying of higher sequenced
   frames is generally done without any knowledge of the higher layer
   protocols in use, let alone any knowledge of higher layer protocol
   contexts (e.g. TCP connections) in the case that the layer 2 link is
   carrying a multiplex of such contexts.  It could, for example, be the
   case that all of the higher sequenced frames being delayed are
   carrying packets for different layer 4 contexts than a single lower-
   sequenced frame that triggered the delay.  The result is that this
   "re-sequencing" operation can introduce delays that result in
   degradation of performance rather than improving it.  Moreover,
   modern, performant TCP and QUIC implementations support features that
   significantly improve their tolerance to out-of-order delivery.

   This draft is intended to promote an analysis and discussion of the
   sensitivity of modern protocols to out-of-order delivery, and to
   potentially develop new guidance to layer 2 technology standards
   regarding the need to assure in-order delivery.

1.  Introduction

   Section 15 of [RFC3819] provides advice to Internet subnetwork
   designers regarding packet reordering.  The advice seems reasonable:
   "try to avoid packet reordering whenever possible, but not if doing
   so compromises efficiency, impairs reliability, or increases average
   packet delay."  However, along with this guidance come a couple of
   warnings that appear to have driven subnetwork designers towards
   assuring in-order delivery even if efficiency is impaired or average
   packet delay is increased.  These warnings relate to the potential
   performance cost for TCP (as it was then defined) that arises due to
   out-of-order arrivals, and to the fact that out-of-order delivery
   would cause problems for "every header compression scheme currently
   standardized for the Internet."

   The text of [RFC3819] does mention that research on improving TCP
   behavior in the face of packet reordering was underway.  In the
   intervening 20+ years, that research has resulted in the definition
   of RACK [RFC8985] which significantly reduces TCP's sensitivity to
   out-of-order arrivals.  In addition, Section 6.1 of [RFC9002]
   discusses the usefulness of implementing similar mechanisms in QUIC,
   and provides the protocol tools to do so.  Moreover, neither TCP nor
   QUIC fail in the presence of some out-of-order packets, even if they
   don't implement RACK.  The may see reduced performance, but both
   protocols have the ability to correctly handle the receipt of packets
   out of order.

   TODO: discuss current state of header compression

   In addition to the warnings about TCP and header compression
   discussed in [RFC3819], there may be other protocols that are
   sensitive to reordering.  For instance, Section 4.1 of [RFC2983]
   discusses IPSec [RFC2401] and L2TP [RFC2661] as being sensitive to
   packet reordering.

   TODO: describe "resequencing" generally

   The current situation seems to be that several layer 2 technologies
   implement resequencing functions that increase cost and complexity of
   equipment, and may in many cases degrade network performance rather
   than improving it.  Any benefits of resequencing may be primarily
   limited to older protocol implementations e.g. maintaining the
   performance of older TCP implementations that are no longer widely
   used and may not be particularly performant by modern standards.

2.  Terminology

   In this document, we adopt the following terminology.

   Reordering:
      The process where the packet/frame sequence is made out-of-order
      from the originally transmitted order.

   Resequencing:
      The process where an out-of-order packet/frame sequence is
      returned to the originally transmitted order.

3.  Reordering in L2 Links

   In current L2 link technologies, frame reordering comes from two
   primary sources: multi-link aggregation and layer-2 retransmission.

3.1.  Multi-Link Aggregation

   Some link technologies support the aggregation (within L2) of
   multiple links between a pair of nodes for the purpose of increasing
   the total capacity of the link.  In some cases the individual links
   within the aggregation could have different capacities and/or
   latencies from one another.  When this is the case, the frame
   reception order can differ from the frame transmission order.

3.2.  Layer 2 Retransmissions

   Some link technologies (particularly wireless), are subject to noise
   and interference that would result in an unacceptably high frame
   error rate if it were not corrected.  These links commonly implement
   a method of acknowledgement and retransmission of lost frames,
   referred to as Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ).  When a frame loss
   affects one or more frames within a transmission, and the frame(s) at
   the end are unaffected, the retransmitted frames will arrive out of
   sequence from the original ordering.

4.  Resequencing in L2 Standards

   This section discusses functions and requirements for resequencing in
   exising layer 2 standards.

4.1.  LTE/5G

   Packet reordering can occur on both the MAC and the RLC layer in LTE
   and 5G systems.  Packet resequencing occurs on the PDCP layer.

   On the MAC layer: An RLC packet data unit (RLC-PDU) is transmitted in
   one of up to 16 Hybrid ARQ processes on the MAC layer.  This avoids
   the stop and wait for one transmission to succed before a new
   transmission can begin.  Transmission on the MAC layer can however
   have a high block error rate (BLER), 10% or more is common especially
   when the traffic pattern and radio channel varies.  Each
   retransmission adds a few milliseconds extra delay.  This results in
   that packets are delivered out of order up to the RLC layer on the
   receiver side because some transmissions on the MAC layer may succeed
   in one transmission attempt while other transmissions may need
   several attepts, up to some given limit given by system
   configuration.  HARQ failure is triggered when the max number of
   retransmissions is reached.

   On the RLC Layer: The RLC layer is configured in two typical ways.

4.2.  Wi-Fi

   The IEEE 802.11 specification (Wi-Fi) currently supports only in-
   order delivery.  The 802.11 protocols inherit traffic delivery
   requirements from the 802.1Q specification (see section 6.5.3 in
   802.1Q), which only permits only in-order delivery.

   To utilize the medium efficiently, the 802.11 MAC aggregates data
   frames of a given traffic identifier (TID) and transmits them as a
   block.  However, due to link errors, not all frames in the block may
   be received.  A re-order buffer at the receiver holds up delivery of
   data frames if a frame ahead of it is missing.  A separate reorder
   buffer is maintained for each of the 8 TIDs.  A later retransmission
   may deliver the missing frame at which point the missing frame and
   subsequent frames are delivered.

   The process of in-order delivery is also taken advantage of as part
   of the security protocol.  Each data frame is sequentially numbered
   with a packet number.  To mitigate against a replay attack, the
   receiving MAC simply checks if the packet number of a received data
   frames is higher than the highest received one for that TID.

   Allowing out-of-order delivery within the 802.11 specification for a
   given TID would require some adjustments to the 802.11 protocol.
   Some of the adjustments include the following:

   *  The reorder buffer would need to release packets without waiting
      for older packets to be received.

   *  The replay detection mechanism would need to be updated to not
      drop an older missing frame when it is successfully retransmitted.

4.3.  DOCSIS

   The Data-Over-Cable Service Interface Specifications provide
   broadband access over hybrid fiber-coaxial networks.  The DOCSIS
   protocol does not support layer 2 retransmissions, but since the
   introduction of "channel bonding" functionality (a form of multi-link
   aggregation) in DOCSIS 3.0 in 2006, reordering can occur due to
   differences in capacity or latency between the bonded channels.  All
   equipment built to that and later versions of DOCSIS (including
   DOCSIS 3.1 and DOCSIS 4.0) is required to support specific
   resequencing features to guarantee in-order delivery.

   In the downstream direction (i.e. from the network to end-user)
   individual IP packets are encapsulated in layer 2 frames that
   generally include a 20-bit Downstream Service ID (DSID), a 1-bit
   Sequence Change Count, and a 16-bit Packet Sequence Number.  The
   specifications include detailed, manadatory, requirements on the
   handling of these fields, including a requirement that cable modems
   support at least 16 simultaneous resequencing contexts, each of which
   having sufficient memory to hold packets for up to 13 ms (18 ms in
   older equipment) at the maximum forwarding rate of the device,
   mechanisms for rapid loss detection, and significant management and
   configuration mechanisms to support the feature.

   In the upstream direction (i.e. from the end-user to the network)
   individual IP packets are encapsulated in layer 2 frames, then
   concatenated together and fragmented into "segments" for
   transmission.  The segment boundaries are determined by the size of
   the transmission opportunities (grants) and generally do not relate
   to the internal frame or packet boundaries.  So, in general a segment
   could begin with the tail of one L2 frame, then have zero or more
   full L2 frames, then the head of a final frame.  Each segment has a
   segment header which contains a 13-bit sequence number.  The CMTS is
   required to reassemble the concatenated frame sequence, and forward
   the individual frames in order.

    <abstract>
      <t>Several link technology standards mandate that equipment guarantee in-order delivery of layer 2 frames, apparently due to a belief that this is required by higher layer protocols.  In addition, certain link types can introduce out-of-order arrivals at the end of the layer 2 link, which the receiving equipment is required to rectify by delaying higher sequenced frames until all lower sequenced frames can be delivered or are deemed lost.  The delaying of higher sequenced frames is generally done without any knowledge of the higher layer protocols in use, let alone any knowledge of higher layer protocol contexts (e.g. TCP connections) in the case that the layer 2 link is carrying a multiplex of such contexts. It could, for example, be the case that all of the higher sequenced frames being delayed are carrying packets for different layer 4 contexts than a single lower-sequenced frame that triggered the delay. The result is that this "re-sequencing" operation can introduce delays that result in degradation of performance rather than improving it.  Moreover, modern, performant TCP and QUIC implementations support features that significantly improve their tolerance to out-of-order delivery.</t>
      <t>This draft is intended to promote an analysis and discussion of the sensitivity of modern protocols to out-of-order delivery, and to potentially develop new guidance to layer 2 technology standards regarding the need to assure in-order delivery, when doing so could degrade performance.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>Section 15 of RFC3819 provides advice to Internet subnetwork designers regarding packet reordering. The advice seems to be reasonable: try to avoid packet reordering whenever possible, but not if doing so compromises efficiency, impairs reliability, or increases average packet delay.  However, along with this guidance come a couple of warnings that appear to have driven subnetwork designers towards assuring in-order delivery even if efficiency is impaired or average packet delay is increased.  These warnings relate to the potential performance cost for TCP (as it was then defined) that arises due to out-of-order arrivals, and to the fact that out-of-order delivery would cause problems for "every header compression scheme currently standardized for the Internet." </t>

           Proposed Updates to Guidance on Packet Reordering
                 draft-white-intarea-reordering-latest

Abstract

   Several link technology standards mandate that equipment guarantee
   in-order delivery of layer 2 frames, apparently due to a belief that
   this is required by higher layer protocols.  In addition, certain
   link types can introduce out-of-order arrivals at the end of the
   layer 2 link, which the receiving equipment is required to rectify by
   delaying higher sequenced frames until all lower sequenced frames can
   be delivered or are deemed lost.  The delaying of higher sequenced
   frames is generally done without any knowledge of the higher layer
   protocols in use, let alone any knowledge of higher layer protocol
   contexts (e.g. TCP connections) in the case that the layer 2 link is
   carrying a multiplex of such contexts.  It could, for example, be the
   case that all of the higher sequenced frames being delayed are
   carrying packets for different layer 4 contexts than a single lower-
   sequenced frame that triggered the delay.  The result is that this
   "re-sequencing" operation can introduce delays that result in
   degradation of performance rather than improving it.  Moreover,
   modern, performant TCP and QUIC implementations support features that
   significantly improve their tolerance to out-of-order delivery.

   This draft is intended to promote an analysis and discussion of the
   sensitivity of modern protocols to out-of-order delivery, and to
   potentially develop new guidance to layer 2 technology standards
   regarding the need to assure in-order delivery, when doing so could
   degrade performance.

1.  Introduction

   Section 15 of RFC3819 provides advice to Internet subnetwork
   designers regarding packet reordering.  The advice seems to be
   reasonable: try to avoid packet reordering whenever possible, but not
   if doing so compromises efficiency, impairs reliability, or increases
   average packet delay.  However, along with this guidance come a
   couple of warnings that appear to have driven subnetwork designers
   towards assuring in-order delivery even if efficiency is impaired or
   average packet delay is increased.  These warnings relate to the
   potential performance cost for TCP (as it was then defined) that
   arises due to out-of-order arrivals, and to the fact that out-of-
   order delivery would cause problems for "every header compression
   scheme currently standardized for the Internet."
